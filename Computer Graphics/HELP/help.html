          Fractals is about Koch Curve and Dragon Curve
        </p4>

        <p5>
          What is Koch Curve?

          The Koch snowflake (also known as the Koch curve, Koch star, or Koch island) is a mathematical curve and one of the earliest fractal curves to have been described.
           It is based on the Koch curve, which appeared in a 1904 paper titled “On a continuous curve without tangents, constructible from elementary geometry” by the Swedish mathematician Helge von Koch.

          The progression for the area of the snowflake converges to 8/5 times the area of the original triangle, while the progression for the snowflake’s perimeter diverges to infinity.
           Consequently, the snowflake has a finite area bounded by an infinitely long line.
          </p5>

          <p6>
           What is Dragon Curve?
          A dragon curve is any member of a family of self-similar fractal curves, which can be approximated by recursive methods such as Lindenmayer systems. The dragon curve is probably most commonly thought 
          of as the shape that is generated from repeatedly folding a strip of paper in half, although there are other curves that are called dragon curves that are generated differently.

         What is triangle?
         More generally, an affine transformation is an automorphism of an affine space (Euclidean spaces are specific affine spaces), 
         that is, a function which maps an affine space onto itself while preserving both the dimension of any affine subspaces (meaning that it sends points to points, lines to lines, planes to planes, and so on) 
         and the ratios of the lengths of parallel line segments. Consequently, sets of parallel affine subspaces remain parallel after an affine transformation. An affine transformation does not necessarily preserve angles between lines or
          distances between points, though it does preserve ratios of distances between points lying on a straight line.

        What is RGB and HSL?
        RGB color values are supported in all browsers.

        An RGB color value is specified with: rgb(red, green, blue).
        
        Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color as an integer between 0 and 255.
        
        For example, rgb(0, 0, 255) is rendered as blue, because the blue parameter is set to its highest value (255) and the others are set to 0.
        HSL color values are supported in IE9+, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and in Opera 10+.

HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness.
